## Loan Prediction

This project aims to predict loan approval status based on various applicant features such as income, education, and credit history. The dataset includes information about loan applicants and their loan statuses. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handled missing values through imputation (mode for categorical variables and mean for numerical variables).
   - Performed one-hot encoding on categorical features.
   - Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance in the target variable.
   - Normalized the data using MinMaxScaler.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualized distributions and relationships in the data.
   - Identified key trends, such as income distributions and the relationship between credit history and loan approval.

3. **Modeling**: 
   - Implemented various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   - Evaluated each model based on accuracy.

4. **Model Comparison**: 
   - Compared model performance to select the most accurate model for predicting loan approval.
